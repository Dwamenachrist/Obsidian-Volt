You got it! Here's the link to the CheXNet paper on arXiv:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05225
This paper will give you a deep dive into the CheXNet model, its architecture, and how it was trained. You'll also find links to the GitHub repository where you can access the code and pre-trained models.
Happy exploring! Let me know if you have any other questions or want to brainstorm further. ✨

You bet! Here's the link to the original CheXNet code on GitHub:
https://github.com/arnoweng/CheXNet
This repository contains the code, along with instructions on how to use it. You'll find everything you need to get started exploring and experimenting with CheXNet.
Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps you'd like to explore some other X-ray analysis projects, or maybe you have questions about specific AI/ML techniques. I'm here to help you brainstorm and bring your healthcare AI vision to life! ✨
