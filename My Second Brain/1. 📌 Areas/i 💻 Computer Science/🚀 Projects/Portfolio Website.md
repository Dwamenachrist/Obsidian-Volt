# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for handwritten digit recognition, a foundational problem in computer vision. Our objective was to create a robust solution capable of accurately identifying digits (0-9) from grayscale images using the MNIST dataset.

Computer Vision is a subfield of [[Artificial Intelligence]] that enables computers to interpret and analyze visual data. The pipeline typically involves:

1. Image Acquisition: Collecting and loading images.
    
2. Image Processing: Removing noise, adjusting contrast, and normalizing data.
    
3. Feature Extraction: Identifying edges, corners, and textures essential for classification.
    

  

## 2. Dataset Overview

### Dataset Source

We utilized the MNIST dataset, downloaded from Kaggle: [MNIST Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset)

### Dataset Details

- Description: The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
    
- Dataset Format: IDX, a compact and efficient format designed for storing numerical data.
    
- Pixel Values: Each pixel is represented by a value between 0 (black) and 255 (white), with shades of gray in between.
    
- Image Dimensions: 28x28 pixels.
    

### Key Statistics

- Training Samples: 60,000 images.
    
- Testing Samples: 10,000 images.
    

  
  

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Class Distribution Insights

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfId-wtdfzU6zJXFAlchJZC5DQ2gU7uFev74M8oeCJPSerBOX1VJbrmCiLq9Gstqc54Yw4tqpm4OqsZ0S3rkD15YTOecDSeUA-CHArdHrp-cUiLOkw-MnLrSmhTXM_NXT1o9240PQ?key=TvTf9FON4erWTSoFyVCflTFq)

The distribution of digits in the training set is as follows:

- Most Frequent: The digit "1" appears 6,742 times, making it the most common digit.
    
- Least Frequent: The digit "5" appears only 5,421 times, making it the least common digit.
    
- Difference in Frequency: The largest class ("1") has 1,321 more samples than the smallest class ("5"). This translates to a 22.8% difference.
    

### Why the Difference is Acceptable

4. Dataset Size: The MNIST dataset contains a large number of samples (60,000 for training). Even for the least frequent digit ("5"), there are still over 5,400 samples. This is a sufficiently large number to train the model effectively without causing under-representation issues.
    
5. Class Balance Metric:
    

- To quantify class balance, we can calculate the percentage share of each digit in the dataset:
    

- Digit "1": 11.24%
    
- Digit "5": 9.04%
    

- While there is a small imbalance (2.2 percentage points), it is minimal compared to datasets with severe imbalance (e.g., where one class constitutes <5% of total samples).
    

6. ### Effect on Model Training:
    

- Modern machine learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are robust to minor class imbalances, especially when trained on large datasets. The slight variation here is unlikely to result in bias toward or against any specific digit.
    

### Recommendations for Mitigating Imbalance

To further ensure the model is unaffected by the imbalance, the following steps were taken:

7. Data Augmentation: More synthetic samples of the underrepresented class ("5") were generated using techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This enhances class balance during training.
    
8. Class Weights: The loss function was adjusted using class weights to assign slightly higher importance to misclassifications of less frequent digits.
    

  

## 3. Data Preprocessing

To prepare the MNIST dataset for model training, several preprocessing steps were applied:

### 3.1 Grayscale Normalization

- Purpose: To standardize the pixel intensity values and improve model performance.
    
- Process: Each pixel in the grayscale image was normalized to a value between 0 and 1. This ensures that the model is not biased towards images with higher or lower overall intensity.
    

### 3.2 Reshaping

- Purpose: To accommodate the input requirements of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
    
- Process: Each 28x28 pixel image was reshaped into a 3D tensor with dimensions (28, 28, 1). The additional dimension represents the single color channel (grayscale) of the image. This reshaping step ensures that the input data is compatible with the CNN architecture.
    

### 3.3 Data Augmentation (Not yet implemented)

- Purpose: To artificially increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.
    
- Process: A variety of data augmentation techniques were applied to the training images, including:
    

- Rotation: Images were rotated by random angles to expose the model to different orientations.
    
- Zooming: Images were zoomed in or out to simulate variations in image scale.
    
- Shifting: Images were shifted horizontally or vertically to account for potential misalignments.
    

By applying these data augmentation techniques, the model is exposed to a wider range of image variations, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving its ability to recognize handwritten digits accurately.

Implementation

The preprocessing steps were implemented using the powerful NumPy and TensorFlow libraries. NumPy was used for efficient array operations, while TensorFlow's image utilities provided convenient functions for reshaping, normalization, and data augmentation.

[Insert Visual Example: Original Image vs. Augmented Image]

The provided visual example illustrates the effect of data augmentation on a sample image. The original image is transformed into various augmented versions by applying rotations, zooms, and shifts. This augmented dataset helps the model learn to recognize digits in different orientations and scales.

  

## 4. Modeling

  

### 4.1 Model Selection

How did we come up with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).  
From our research it is the most known and widely used Neural network that is good with images and videos for computer vision.

CNN are specifically designed to capture spatial hierarchies in data making them well suited for analyzing the patterns and features present in handwritten digits.

CNN analyze an image layer by layer, starting with the basic clues and building up to a complete understanding of the scene.  
  

Handwritten digits also have spatial hierarchies:

- Low-level: Curves, lines, and angles.
    
- Mid-level: Combinations of those form loops, circles, and intersections.
    
- High-level: The complete digit (recognizing a "9" from its overall shape).
    

  

### 4.2 Model Architecture

My chosen CNN architecture is as follows:

  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([

        # First convolutional block

        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),

        tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),

        tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2)),

  

        # Second convolutional block

        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),

        tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),

        tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2)),

  

        # Flatten

        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),

  

        # Dense layers

        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),

        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),  # Regularization

        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    ])

  

  return model

  
  

### Explanation:

Convolutional Blocks: The model has two convolutional block, each block consist of:

Conv2D layer: This layer performs the convolution operation, extracting features from  the input image using learned filters.

What is it the 32 and 64 filters?

Why 32 and 64 filters?

Starting with a smaller number of filtera (32) in the first layer and increasing it (64) in the second block allows the network to learn increasingly complex features. How 

Why (3,3) kernel size?

A 3x3 kernel is a common choice as it captures local patterns effectively.

Why ReLU activation? 

ReLU introduces non-linearity, which is essential for learning complex patterns.

Batch Normalization: This layer normalizes the activations of the previous layer, stabilizing training and improving performance.

MaxPool2D: This layer downsamples the feature maps, reducing dimensionality and making the model more robust to small variations in the input.

Flatten Layer: This layer converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, preparing the data for the fully connected layers.  
  

Dense Layers: These layers perform the final classification.  
  

- Why 128 units? This provides a good balance between capacity and complexity.
    
- Why Dropout? Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, preventing overfitting and improving generalization.
    
- Why Softmax activation? Softmax outputs a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes.
    

  

### 4.3 Model Architecture

The model was compiled with the following settings:

Why compile the model?

  

[[Python]]

model = create_mnist_cnn_model()

model.compile(optimizer='adam',

              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',

              metrics=['accuracy'])

  

- Optimizer: Adam is an adaptive optimization algorithm that often performs well for image classification tasks.
    
- Loss Function: Sparse categorical cross-entropy is suitable for multi-class classification problems where the labels are integers (0-9 in this case).
    
- Metrics: Accuracy is used to evaluate the model's performance.
    

  

### 4.4 K-Fold Cross-Validation

### To ensure robust performance evaluation and reduce the influence of data splits, 6-fold cross-validation was employed. The training process for each fold involved 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.

### Python

### # Define the number of folds for k-fold cross-validation

### n_splits = 6  

  

### # Create a KFold object

### kf = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=42) 

  

### # ... (rest of your code for k-fold cross-validation)

  

- ### Shuffling: Shuffling the data before splitting ensures representative folds.
    
- ### Random State: Setting a random state (42) ensures reproducibility.
    

### Benefits of k-fold cross-validation:

- ### Reduced bias: Minimizes the impact of specific train-test splits.
    
- ### Improved generalization: Provides a reliable estimate of performance on unseen data.
    

### Cross-validation results:

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|### Fold|### Training Size|### Validation Size|### Accuracy|### Loss|
|### 1|### 50000|### 10000|### 0.9901|### 0.0601|
|### 2|### 50000|### 10000|### 0.9859|### 0.0658|
