7777What is #IP address? #Internet-Protocol-Address
An IP address uniquely identifies a node (eg: computer or device ) on a
network. Each IP address belongs to a unique subnet, and each subnet may belong to a
different area of the network.

So, an IP address is essentially a unique string of numbers (and sometimes letters) that identifies a device on a network, allowing data to be sent and received accurately.
