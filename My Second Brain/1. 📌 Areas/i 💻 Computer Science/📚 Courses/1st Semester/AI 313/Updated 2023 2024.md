# Solution for question 2.b
### Definition of Rationality

An agent is considered rational if it selects actions that maximize its expected utility, given the information available to it. This means that the agent aims to make the best possible decisions to achieve its goals based on its current knowledge and understanding of the environment.

### Factors Influencing Rationality

1. **Information**
    
    - **Description**: This refers to the agent's knowledge and understanding of its environment and the potential consequences of its actions.
        
    - **Influence**: The more accurate and comprehensive the information an agent has, the better it can predict outcomes and make informed decisions. Incomplete or incorrect information can lead to suboptimal decisions.
        
2. **Preferences**
    
    - **Description**: Preferences are the agent's goals, values, and priorities that determine the utility of different outcomes.
        
    - **Influence**: An agent's decisions are influenced by its preferences, as these define what the agent considers to be valuable or desirable. Clear and consistent preferences help the agent choose actions that align with its goals.
        
3. **Computational Complexity**
    
    - **Description**: This refers to the cognitive resources available to the agent for processing information and making decisions. It includes the agent's ability to handle complex calculations and evaluate multiple options.
        
    - **Influence**: Limited computational resources can constrain an agent's ability to consider all possible actions and outcomes, potentially leading to simplified decision-making processes or heuristics. Efficient algorithms and computational techniques can help an agent manage complexity.
        
4. **Time Constraints**
    
    - **Description**: The amount of time available to the agent to make decisions and take actions.
        
    - **Influence**: Time constraints can impact an agent's decision-making process. When time is limited, the agent may need to make quick decisions with less deliberation, which can affect the quality of the choices. In such cases, the agent may rely on heuristics or approximate methods to make timely decisions.
