Still what are semantics Is it teaching the computer how to understand phrases and sentences like the way humans do. and this can be done using A^B A ʌ B and so on that is the logic and so on

You're on the right track! Semantics is indeed about helping computers understand and interpret phrases and sentences in a way that's similar to how humans do. It involves various methods and frameworks to represent meaning so that machines can process language meaningfully.

In the context of logic, semantics involves using logical symbols and operators, like AND (∧) and OR (∨), to represent and reason about meanings. Here's a bit more detail:

- **Logical Connectives**: These are symbols like ∧ (AND), ∨ (OR), ¬ (NOT), and → (IMPLIES) used in formal logic to combine or alter statements. For example, in the statement A∧BA ∧ B, both AA and BB need to be true for the whole statement to be true.
    
- **Formal Semantics**: This involves using formal systems like predicate logic to represent the meanings of sentences. For example, the sentence "All humans are mortal" can be represented formally as ∀x (Human(x) → Mortal(x)), which means "for all x, if x is a human, then x is mortal."
    
- **Compositional Semantics**: This refers to how the meanings of individual words combine to form the meaning of a whole sentence. For example, the meaning of the sentence "John loves Mary" is derived from the meanings of "John," "loves," and "Mary" and how they are syntactically related.

- AA: The antecedent or premise.
    
- ⊨: The symbol for semantic entailment.
    
- BB: The consequent or conclusion.
    

For example, let's say AA is "All humans are mortal" and BB is "Socrates is mortal". If we know AA is true and that Socrates is a human, then BB must also be true. So, A⊨BA ⊨ B holds in this case.



We call this syntactic process derivation and write KB ⊢ Q. Such syntactic proof systems are called calculi

# What is Derivation?
It is the process of deriving a conclusion from a knowledge base or a set of premises using a formal system of rules.
KB ⊢ Q means that Q can be syntactically derived from KB using a set of inference rules. This process is part of a syntactic proof called #Caluli
