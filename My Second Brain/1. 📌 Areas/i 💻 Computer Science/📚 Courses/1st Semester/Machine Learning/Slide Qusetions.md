**Feature extraction** is the process of reduce the number of features in a dataset by creating new features from the existing ones (and then discarding the original features).

Then what is Feature Engineering?

### What is Regularization?
###### Regularization involves adding penalty term to the models objective function to prevent it from fitting the training data too well. To help the model learn more generalize patterns and reducing the model's complexity.

### How is it working?
1. Adding a penalty term 
2. Simplifying model by helping us find the most important features with the help of the L1 and L2 (Lasso and Ridge Regres)
