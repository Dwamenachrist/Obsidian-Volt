c) interface between the hardware and application programs  
d) all of the mentioned  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** d  
**Explanation:** An Operating System acts as an intermediary between user/user applications/application programs and hardware. It is a program that manages hardware resources. It provides services to application programs.

## 2. To access the services of operating system, the interface is provided by the ___________
a) System calls  
b) API  
c) Library  
d) Assembly instructions  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** a  
**Explanation:** To access services of the Operating System an interface is provided by the System Calls. Generally, these are functions written in C and C++. Open, Close, Read, Write are some of most prominently used system calls.

## 3. Which one of the following is not true?
a) kernel is the program that constitutes the central core of the operating system  
b) kernel is the first part of operating system to load into memory during booting  
c) kernel is made of various modules which can not be loaded in running operating system  
d) kernel remains in the memory during the entire computer session  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** c  
**Explanation:** Kernel is the first program which is loaded in memory when OS is loading as well as it remains in memory till OS is running. Kernel is the core part of the OS which is responsible for managing resources, allowing multiple processes to use the resources and provide services to various processes. Kernel modules can be loaded and unloaded in run-time i.e. in running OS.

## 4. Which one of the following error will be handle by the operating system?
a) power failure  
b) lack of paper in printer  
c) connection failure in the network  
d) all of the mentioned  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** d  
**Explanation:** All the mentioned errors are handled by OS. The OS is continuously monitoring all of its resources. Also, the OS is constantly detecting and correcting errors.

## 5. What is the main function of the command interpreter?
a) to get and execute the next user-specified command  
b) to provide the interface between the API and application program  
c) to handle the files in operating system  
d) none of the mentioned  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** a  
**Explanation:** The main function of command interpreter is to get and execute the next user-specified command. Command Interpreter checks for valid command and then runs that command else it will throw an error.
