The SQL query in question is:

SQL

```
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Biology');
```

Let's break down its functionality:

1. **`SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Biology'`**: This subquery finds the maximum salary among all instructors in the Biology department.
    
2. **`WHERE salary > (...)`**: This clause in the outer query filters the results. It selects only those instructors whose salary is _greater than_ the result of the subquery (i.e., greater than the maximum salary in Biology).
    
3. **`SELECT name FROM instructor`**: This outer query selects the `name` of the instructors who satisfy the `WHERE` clause.
    

Therefore, the query returns the names of all instructors who earn more than the highest salary of any instructor in the Biology department.

Now, let's consider the given options:

- **A. Names of instructors earning more than the highest salary in Biology.** This is the correct interpretation of the query's function.
    
- **B. Produces an error if no instructors exist in Biology.** If there are no instructors in Biology, the subquery `SELECT MAX(salary) ...` will return `NULL`. Comparing a value with `NULL` using `>` results in `UNKNOWN`, which is treated as false in the `WHERE` clause. Therefore, the outer query will simply return an empty result set (no rows), not an error.
    
- **C. NULL if the subquery fails.** The subquery won't "fail" in the sense of producing an error. As explained above, it will return `NULL` if there are no Biology instructors. The outer query will then return an empty set.
    
- **D. Both A and B.** Since B is incorrect, D is also incorrect.
    

Therefore, the correct answer is **A. Names of instructors earning more than the highest salary in Biology.**

# Q4
What is the purpose of the WHERE clause in SQL? A. To group rows based on a condition.

 B. To filter rows based on a condition.

 C. To sort rows in a specific order.

 D. To join multiple tables.


The purpose of the `WHERE` clause in SQL is **B. To filter rows based on a condition.**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

- **A. To group rows based on a condition:** This is the purpose of the `GROUP BY` clause.
- **C. To sort rows in a specific order:** This is the purpose of the `ORDER BY` clause.
- **D. To join multiple tables:** This is the purpose of the `JOIN` clause (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.).

The `WHERE` clause is used to specify a condition that rows must meet to be included in the result set. Only rows that evaluate to true for the condition specified in the `WHERE` clause are returned

# Q5
What is the correct SQL statement to delete a table? A. REMOVE TABLE table_name;

 B. DELETE table_name;

 C. DROP DATABASE table_name;

 D. DROP TABLE table_name;

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The correct SQL statement to delete a table is **D. DROP TABLE table_name;**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

- **A. REMOVE TABLE table_name;** is not a valid SQL command.
- **B. DELETE table_name;** is used to delete _rows_ from a table, not the table itself. To delete all rows from a table, you would use `DELETE FROM table_name;`, but the table structure would still exist.
- **C. DROP DATABASE table_name;** is used to delete an entire database, not a single table. Using this command would delete the database named `table_name` along with all its tables, views, and other objects.


# Q6
Which of the following is used to retrieve all columns from a table? A. SELECT *

 B. SELECT ALL

 C. SELECT COLUMNS

 D. SELECT ALL_COLUMNS

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The correct answer is **A. SELECT ***

`SELECT *` is the standard SQL syntax for retrieving all columns from a table. The asterisk (*) acts as a wildcard, representing all columns.

The other options are incorrect:

- `SELECT ALL` is not a valid SQL command for selecting all columns. `ALL` is often used implicitly (or sometimes explicitly) to indicate that all rows, including duplicates, should be returned (as opposed to `DISTINCT`, which returns only unique rows).
- `SELECT COLUMNS` and `SELECT ALL_COLUMNS` are not standard SQL syntax.

# Q7
![[Pasted image 20250128110850.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary = (SELECT salary FROM instructor WHERE ID = 12345);
```

Let's analyze what it does:

1. **`SELECT salary FROM instructor WHERE ID = 12345`**: This subquery attempts to retrieve the salary of the instructor with ID 12345.
    
2. **`WHERE salary = (...)`**: The outer query then selects the `name` from the `instructor` table where the `salary` is equal to the result of the subquery.
    

Now let's consider the options:

- **A. Names of instructors earning the same salary as instructor with ID 12345.** This is the primary function of the query. It finds all instructors who have the same salary as the instructor with ID 12345. This part is correct.
    
- **B. Produces an error if subquery returns multiple rows.** This is a crucial point. If there are multiple instructors with the ID 12345 (which should ideally not happen in a properly designed database with a primary key constraint on ID), or if there's some other issue causing multiple rows to be returned by the subquery, the comparison `salary = (...)` will result in an error in most SQL [[Databases]]. A scalar subquery (one that is expected to return only a single value) is being used in a context where multiple values would cause an error.
    
- **C. Produces an error if ID 12345 does not exist.** If no instructor with ID 12345 exists, the subquery will return `NULL`. Comparing `salary = NULL` will not cause an error in the traditional sense, but the `WHERE` clause will evaluate to `UNKNOWN` for all rows, effectively filtering out all results. The query will return an empty result set, not a SQL error.
    
- **D. Both A and C.** Since C is incorrect, D is incorrect.


# Q8
![[Pasted image 20250128111052.png]]
Let's break it down:

1. **`SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor`**: This subquery calculates the average salary of _all_ instructors in the `instructor` table.
    
2. **`WHERE salary > (...)`**: The outer query then selects the `name` of instructors from the `instructor` table where their `salary` is _greater than_ the average salary calculated by the subquery.
    

Therefore, the query outputs the names of instructors who earn more than the overall average salary of all instructors.

Now let's look at the options:

- **A. Names of instructors earning more than the average salary in their department.** This is incorrect. The subquery calculates the average salary across _all_ instructors, not within individual departments.
    
- **B. Names of instructors earning more than the overall average salary.** This is the correct interpretation.
    
- **C. Produces an error if AVG(salary) returns NULL.** If there are no instructors in the table (meaning `AVG(salary)` would return `NULL`), the comparison `salary > NULL` will not cause an error. Instead, the `WHERE` clause will evaluate to `UNKNOWN` for all rows, and no rows will be returned. The query will return an empty result set, not an error.
    
- **D. NULL.** The query returns a set of names (or an empty set if no instructors meet the condition), not a single `NULL` value.
    

Therefore, the correct answer is **B. Names of instructors earning more than the overall average salary.**
# Q9
Which of the following is used to retrieve all columns from a table? A. SELECT *

 B. SELECT ALL

 C. SELECT COLUMNS

 D. SELECT ALL_COLUMNS

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The correct answer is **A. SELECT ***

`SELECT *` is the standard SQL syntax for retrieving all columns from a table. The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that represents all columns in the specified table.
# Q10
What does the GROUP BY clause do? A. Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.

 B. Sorts the rows in ascending or descending order.

 C. Removes duplicate rows.

 D. Combines multiple tables into one.

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The `GROUP BY` clause **A. Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

- **B. Sorts the rows in ascending or descending order:** This is the function of the `ORDER BY` clause.
- **C. Removes duplicate rows:** While `GROUP BY` can sometimes be used in conjunction with aggregate functions to effectively remove duplicates in the output, its primary purpose is grouping. `DISTINCT` is the keyword specifically designed to remove duplicate rows.
- **D. Combines multiple tables into one:** This is the function of the `JOIN` clause.

The `GROUP BY` clause is typically used with aggregate functions (like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`) to perform calculations on groups of rows. For example, you could use `GROUP BY department` to calculate the average salary for each department.
# Q11
![[Pasted image 20250128111200.png]]
Here's a breakdown:

- **`SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor`**: This subquery calculates the average salary of _all_ instructors in the `instructor` table.
    
- **`WHERE salary > (...)`**: The outer query selects the `name` of instructors from the `instructor` table where their `salary` is _greater than_ the result of the subquery (the overall average salary).
    

Therefore, the query returns the names of instructors who earn more than the overall average salary.

Considering the options:

- **A. Names of instructors earning above the average salary in their department.** Incorrect. The subquery calculates the average salary across _all_ instructors, not per department.
    
- **B. Names of instructors earning above the overall average salary.** Correct. This is exactly what the query does.
    
- **C. Produces an error if AVG(salary) is NULL.** Incorrect. If there are no rows in the `instructor` table, `AVG(salary)` will return `NULL`. Comparing `salary > NULL` results in `UNKNOWN`, which is treated as false in the `WHERE` clause. The query will return an empty result set, not an error.
    
- **D. NULL.** Incorrect. The query returns a set of names (or an empty set), not a single `NULL` value.
    

So, the correct answer is **B. Names of instructors earning above the overall average salary.**
# Q12
![[Pasted image 20250128111224.png]]
Let's break it down:

1. **`SELECT dept_name FROM teaches WHERE course_id = 'CS303'`**: This subquery selects the `dept_name` from the `teaches` table for all entries where the `course_id` is 'CS303'. In essence, it retrieves the departments that offer the course CS303.
    
2. **`WHERE dept_name IN (...)`**: This clause in the outer query filters the results. It selects only those instructors whose `dept_name` is present in the list of departments returned by the subquery.
    
3. **`SELECT name FROM instructor`**: This outer query selects the `name` of the instructors who meet the condition in the `WHERE` clause.
    

Therefore, the query returns the names of instructors who are in departments that offer the course CS303. It does _not_ necessarily mean the instructors themselves teach the course.

Now let's consider the options:

- **A. Names of instructors teaching CS303.** Incorrect. The query checks the department affiliation, not whether the instructor directly teaches the course.
    
- **B. Names of instructors in departments offering CS303.** Correct. This is the precise function of the query.
    
- **C. Produces an error if CS303 is not found in teaches.** Incorrect. If CS303 is not found in the `teaches` table, the subquery will return an empty set. The `IN` operator will then effectively filter out all rows from the outer query, resulting in an empty result set, not an error.
    
- **D. NULL.** Incorrect. The query returns a set of names (or an empty set), not a single `NULL` value.
    

So, the correct answer is **B. Names of instructors in departments offering CS303.**
# Q13
![[Pasted image 20250128111244.png]]
Let's break down what this query does:

1. **`SELECT DISTINCT dept_name FROM teaches`**: This subquery selects all the unique `dept_name` values from the `teaches` table. This means it retrieves a list of all departments that offer at least one course. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each department name appears only once in the result of the subquery.
    
2. **`WHERE dept_name IN (...)`**: This clause filters the results from the outer query. It checks if the `dept_name` of an instructor (from the `instructor` table) is present in the list of department names returned by the subquery.
    
3. **`SELECT name FROM instructor`**: This outer query selects the `name` of the instructors who meet the condition in the `WHERE` clause.
    

Putting it all together, the query retrieves the names of all instructors who belong to departments that offer at least one course.

Now let's consider the options:

- **A. Names of instructors in departments offering at least one course.** This is the correct interpretation of the query.
    
- **B. Produces an error if teaches is empty.** If the `teaches` table is empty, the subquery will return an empty set. The `IN` operator, when used with an empty set, will cause the `WHERE` clause to evaluate to false for all rows in the `instructor` table. The outer query will then return an empty result set (no rows), not an error.
    
- **C. Names of instructors belonging to departments with courses offered.** This is essentially a rephrasing of option A and is also correct.
    
- **D. NULL.** The query will return a set of names (or an empty set if no instructors meet the condition), not a single `NULL` value.
    

Since options A and C are semantically the same and both correct, if this is a multiple-choice question where only one answer is expected, either A or C would be acceptable. However, if multiple answers are allowed, then both A and C are correct. For this explanation, we will say **A and C are correct**.
# Q14
![[Pasted image 20250128111329.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Physics')
  AND dept_name = 'Math';
```

Let's break it down:

1. **`SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Physics'`**: This subquery finds the maximum salary among all instructors in the Physics department.
    
2. **`WHERE salary > (...)`**: This part of the outer query filters instructors whose salary is greater than the maximum salary in Physics.
    
3. **`AND dept_name = 'Math'`**: This _additional_ condition further filters the results to include only instructors who belong to the Math department.
    

Therefore, the query selects the names of instructors who are in the Math department _and_ earn more than the maximum salary of any instructor in the Physics department.

Now let's look at the options:

- **A. NULL:** Incorrect. The query will return a set of names (or an empty set if no instructors meet the criteria), not a single `NULL` value.
    
- **B. Names of instructors earning more than the maximum salary in Physics and belong to Math.** This is a correct description of the query's function.
    
- **C. Produces an error if no instructors exist in Physics.** Incorrect. If there are no instructors in Physics, the subquery `SELECT MAX(salary) ...` will return `NULL`. Comparing `salary > NULL` will evaluate to `UNKNOWN` in the `WHERE` clause, effectively filtering out all results. The query will return an empty set, not an error.
    
- **D. Names of instructors in Math earning more than the maximum salary in Physics.** This is also a correct and more precise description than B.
    

Since D is more precise than B, **D** is the best answer. B is not incorrect but D is better.
# Q15
Which SQL data type represents a period of time (e.g., days, hours)? A. DATE

 B. TIMESTAMP

 C. INTERVAL

 D. TIME

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The SQL data type that represents a period of time (e.g., days, hours) is **C. INTERVAL**.

Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

- **A. DATE:** Represents a specific calendar date (year, month, day).
- **B. TIMESTAMP:** Represents a specific point in time, including date and time (and sometimes fractional seconds or time zone information).
- **D. TIME:** Represents a time of day (hours, minutes, seconds).

`INTERVAL` is designed specifically to represent a duration or a span of time. For example, you could have an interval of "3 days," "2 hours 30 minutes," or "1 year 6 months." It's used for calculations involving time differences.
# Q17
What is the purpose of the *pre-compiler* in a DBMS? A. Map external views

 B. Extract DML commands from host programs

 C. Optimize queries

 D. Define schemas

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The purpose of a _pre-compiler_ in a DBMS is **B. Extract DML commands from host programs.**

Here's why:

When you embed SQL statements (Data Manipulation Language - DML) within a host programming language (like C, [[Java]], or [[Python]]), the pre-compiler's job is to:

1. **Identify the embedded SQL statements:** It recognizes the special syntax that marks the beginning and end of embedded SQL (e.g., `EXEC SQL` in some systems).
    
2. **Extract the SQL statements:** It separates the SQL code from the host language code.
    
3. **Replace the SQL statements with host language calls:** It substitutes the SQL code with function calls or other code that allows the host program to communicate with the database system at runtime.
    
4. **Create a modified source code file:** This file contains the host language code with the SQL parts replaced by calls to the database interface. This modified file is then compiled by the regular host language compiler.
    

The other options are incorrect:

- **A. Map external views:** This is handled by the database's view mechanism, not a pre-compiler.
- **C. Optimize queries:** Query optimization is performed by the query optimizer within the DBMS's query processor.
- **D. Define schemas:** Schema definition is done using Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, which are handled directly by the DBMS, not a pre-compiler.
# Q18
What does the INTERSECT operator do? A. Removes duplicates from a single query

 B. Returns rows common to both queries

 C. Combines all rows from two queries

 D. Sorts results alphabetically

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The **INTERSECT** operator in SQL **B. Returns rows common to both queries.**

Here's how it works:

- **Purpose:** The INTERSECT operator is used to retrieve rows that exist in the result sets of two or more SELECT queries.
    
- **Functionality:**
    
    - It executes each of the SELECT queries independently.
    - It then compares the resulting sets of rows.
    - Finally, it returns only the rows that are present in _both_ result sets.

**Example:**

If you have two queries:

SQL

```
SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2024-01-01';
SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';
```

The INTERSECT operator would return the customer IDs of those customers who placed an order on January 1st, 2024, _and_ live in New York City.

**Other options:**

- **A. Removes duplicates from a single query:** This is achieved using the `DISTINCT` keyword within a single SELECT query.
- **C. Combines all rows from two queries:** This is achieved using the `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operators.
- **D. Sorts results alphabetically:** This is achieved using the `ORDER BY` clause.

If you'd like, you can give me another SQL concept, and I'll explain it!
# Q19
A left outer join between tables course and prereq ensures: A. All tuples from course are retained, with NULLs for unmatched prereq entries

 B. All tuples from prereq are retained

 C. Tuples are sorted alphabetically

 D. Only matching tuples are retained

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

A left outer join between tables `course` and `prereq` ensures **A. All tuples from course are retained, with NULLs for unmatched prereq entries.**

Here's a breakdown of how left outer joins work and why the other options are incorrect:

- **Left Outer Join:** In a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` (or simply `LEFT JOIN`), all rows from the left table (in this case, `course`) are included in the result. If there is a matching row in the right table (`prereq`) based on the join condition, the columns from the right table are included in the result as well. However, if there is _no_ matching row in the right table, the columns from the right table will have `NULL` values in the resulting row.
    
- **B. All tuples from prereq are retained:** This describes a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` (or `RIGHT JOIN`), where all rows from the right table are retained.
    
- **C. Tuples are sorted alphabetically:** Sorting is handled by the `ORDER BY` clause, not by the join type.
    
- **D. Only matching tuples are retained:** This describes an `INNER JOIN`, where only rows that have matches in _both_ tables based on the join condition are included in the result.
    

Therefore, the defining characteristic of a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` is that it preserves all rows from the left table, padding with `NULL`s where there are no matches in the right table.
# Q20
What is the purpose of the CLOB data type? A. Store large text data

 B. Represent timestamps

 C. Store binary files like images

 D. Define user domains

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The purpose of the **CLOB (Character Large Object)** data type is **A. Store large text data**.

Here's why:

- **CLOB:** Designed to hold very large amounts of text data, such as long documents, articles, or source code.
- **TIMESTAMP:** Used to represent a point in time with date and time information.
- **BLOB (Binary Large Object):** Used to store large binary data like images, audio, or video files.
- **Domain:** A user-defined data type that is based on an existing built-in data type (e.g., a domain for positive integers).

Therefore, CLOB is specifically designed for storing large text content within a database.
# Q21
Which clause is mandatory in an SQL DELETE statement to remove all rows from a table? A. HAVING

 B. None (omitting WHERE deletes all rows)

 C. WHERE

 D. USING

Reset Selection

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The correct answer is **B. None (omitting WHERE deletes all rows)**

Here's why:

- **`DELETE FROM table_name;`**: This statement, _without_ a `WHERE` clause, will delete _all_ rows from the specified table. The table structure itself remains intact.
    
- **`DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`**: This form of the `DELETE` statement, _with_ a `WHERE` clause, deletes only the rows that satisfy the specified condition.
    

Therefore, to delete all rows, you simply omit the `WHERE` clause. The other options are incorrect:

- **A. HAVING:** The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups _after_ they have been grouped by the `GROUP BY` clause. It's not relevant to deleting all rows.
    
- **C. WHERE:** While the `WHERE` clause is used for filtering which rows to delete, it's not mandatory. Omitting it means all rows are deleted.
    
- **D. USING:** The `USING` clause is used in some database systems (like PostgreSQL) in conjunction with `DELETE` statements when deleting rows based on a join with another table. It's not required for deleting all rows from a single table.
# Q22
The CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statement: A. Stores data temporarily within a transaction

 B. Permanently stores data

 C. Replaces base tables

 D. Automatically indexes columns

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` statement **A. Stores data temporarily within a transaction** (or sometimes a session, depending on the specific database system).

Here's a breakdown:

- **Temporary Tables:** These tables are created for temporary storage of data during a database session or transaction. They are automatically dropped at the end of the session or transaction that created them. This makes them useful for storing intermediate results of complex queries or for other temporary data manipulation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

- **B. Permanently stores data:** This is the purpose of regular (non-temporary) tables created with `CREATE TABLE`.
    
- **C. Replaces base tables:** Temporary tables are separate from base tables; they do not replace them. They exist alongside the regular tables.
    
- **D. Automatically indexes columns:** While you _can_ create indexes on temporary tables, it's not done automatically by the `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` statement itself. You would use `CREATE INDEX` on the temporary table just as you would on a regular table.
# Q23
The hierarchical and network models fall under which category of data models? A. Representational

 B. Physical

 C. Object

 D. Conceptual

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The hierarchical and network models fall under the category of **A. Representational** data models.

**Data Models** can be broadly categorized into:

- **Conceptual Models:** These models focus on high-level business requirements and how data is organized within the organization. Examples include Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams.
    
- **Logical Models:** These models represent how data is organized and structured within the database. The hierarchical and network models fall into this category. They define relationships between data elements using specific structures like trees (hierarchical) or graphs (network).
    
- **Physical Models:** These models represent how data is physically stored on the storage devices. This includes details like file organization, indexing methods, and data storage techniques.
    
- **Object Models:** These models represent data as objects with attributes and methods (behaviors). They are used in object-oriented [[Databases]].
    

**Therefore, the hierarchical and network models are considered representational models because they represent data in a specific structured format (tree-like or graph-like) that is used to organize and access the data.**
# Q24
Which SQL feature ensures a column cannot contain NULL values? A. UNIQUE

 B. NOT NULL

 C. CHECK

 D. DEFAULT

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The SQL feature that ensures a column cannot contain `NULL` values is **B. NOT NULL**.

Here's why:

- **NOT NULL:** This constraint explicitly prohibits `NULL` values from being inserted into a column. If you attempt to insert a `NULL` value into a `NOT NULL` column, the database will raise an error.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

- **UNIQUE:** This constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct (no duplicates). It does _not_ prevent `NULL` values, and in some database systems, multiple `NULL` values are even allowed in a `UNIQUE` column.
    
- **CHECK:** This constraint defines a condition that values in a column must satisfy. While you _could_ use a `CHECK` constraint to indirectly prevent `NULL` values (e.g., `CHECK (column_name IS NOT NULL)`), the `NOT NULL` constraint is the standard and more direct way to achieve this.
    
- **DEFAULT:** This specifies a default value that will be used if no value is provided during an `INSERT` operation. While it provides a value in the absence of an explicit one, it doesn't directly prevent `NULL` values from being inserted if explicitly specified.
# Q25
Which SQL standard was published in 1992? A. SQL-86

 B. SQL-92

 C. SQL-1999

 D. SAA-SQL

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The SQL standard published in 1992 is **B. SQL-92**.

The main SQL standards and their approximate publication years are:

- **SQL-86:** 1986 (the first official SQL standard)
- **SQL-92:** 1992 (a major revision that introduced many important features)
- **SQL:1999** (introduced features like triggers, object-relational features, and more)
- **SQL:2003, SQL:2006, SQL:2008, SQL:2011, SQL:2016, SQL:2019, SQL:2023:** Subsequent revisions adding more features and refinements.

SAA-SQL was IBM's proprietary SQL implementation for its Systems Application Architecture (SAA). While influential, it was not the official ANSI/ISO SQL standard.
# Q26
The term *schema evolution* refers to: A. Dynamic user operations

 B. Rare modifications to the schema

 C. Query optimization

 D. Frequent changes to the database state

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

The term **schema evolution** refers to **B. Rare modifications to the schema**.

Here's a breakdown:

- **Schema Evolution:** This term specifically refers to the process of making changes to the database schema (the structure of the database, including tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints). These changes can include adding, modifying, or deleting tables, columns, constraints, and relationships.
    
- **Why "Rare"?** Schema changes are typically considered significant operations because they can impact the entire database system. They require careful planning and testing to avoid data loss, inconsistencies, and application errors. Therefore, they are usually not performed frequently.
    
- **Other Options:**
    
    - **A. Dynamic user operations:** This refers to the actions performed by users interacting with the database (e.g., inserting, updating, deleting data).
        
    - **C. Query optimization:** This is the process of finding the most efficient way to execute a given SQL query.
        
    - **D. Frequent changes to the database state:** This refers to the frequent modifications of the data within the database tables, not the structure of the database itself.
        

Therefore, schema evolution specifically focuses on the changes to the database schema itself, which are generally infrequent due to their potential impact.

# Q27
What is a *valid state* in a database? A. Schema without constraints

 B. Unmapped external views

 C. Empty database

 D. Data complying with schema constraints

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

A _valid state_ in a database is **D. Data complying with schema constraints.**

Here's why:

- **Schema:** The schema of a database defines its structure, including the tables, columns, data types, and constraints (rules) that the data must adhere to.
    
- **Constraints:** Constraints enforce rules on the data, such as:
    
    - **Primary keys:** Uniqueness and non-nullness of primary key values.
    - **Foreign keys:** Referential integrity between tables.
    - **NOT NULL constraints:** Ensuring that certain columns cannot have `NULL` values.
    - **UNIQUE constraints:** Ensuring that values in a column are unique.
    - **CHECK constraints:** Defining custom conditions that data must satisfy.
- **Valid State:** A database is in a valid state when all of its data satisfies all of the constraints defined in its schema. If any constraint is violated, the database is considered to be in an _invalid state_.
    

The other options are incorrect:

- **A. Schema without constraints:** A schema can exist without explicit constraints, but a "valid state" refers to the data _in relation to_ the schema (whether it has constraints or not). A schema without constraints simply means all data is technically valid.
- **B. Unmapped external views:** External views are virtual tables based on queries. Their mapping doesn't define the validity of the underlying data.
- **C. Empty database:** An empty database technically doesn't violate any constraints, so it could be considered a valid state. However, the more complete definition of a valid state emphasizes the adherence of data to _existing_ constraints. So D is more correct.
# Q28
Which statement correctly creates an index on the student table’s ID column? A. INDEX student_id ON student

 B. ALTER TABLE student ADD INDEX (ID)

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**B. ALTER TABLE student ADD INDEX (ID)**

This is the correct syntax to create an index on the `ID` column of the `student` table in most SQL dialects.

**Explanation:**

- **ALTER TABLE student:** This part of the statement specifies that we are modifying the structure of the `student` table.
- **ADD INDEX (ID):** This part indicates that we are adding an index to the table, specifically on the `ID` column.

**Alternative syntax (depending on the database system):**

Some database systems might also support a syntax like:

SQL

```
CREATE INDEX student_id_index ON student (ID);
```

where `student_id_index` is the name of the index.

**Purpose of Indexes:**

Indexes are data structures that improve the efficiency of data retrieval. They allow the database system to quickly locate rows based on the values in the indexed column(s). In this case, an index on the `ID` column would significantly speed up queries that involve searching for specific students based on their ID.
# Q29
![[Pasted image 20250128111721.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
SELECT dept_name, COUNT(*)
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor)
GROUP BY dept_name;
```

Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **`SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor`**: This subquery calculates the average salary of _all_ instructors across all departments.
    
2. **`WHERE salary > (...)`**: This clause filters the instructors, selecting only those whose salary is greater than the overall average salary calculated in the subquery.
    
3. **`GROUP BY dept_name`**: This clause groups the filtered instructors by their department name.
    
4. **`SELECT dept_name, COUNT(*)`**: This selects the department name and the count of instructors within each department _after_ the filtering and grouping.
    

Therefore, the query returns the department names and the number of instructors in each department whose salary is greater than the overall average salary.

Now let's look at the options:

- **A. Department names and the total number of courses offered by each department.** Incorrect. The query is working with the `instructor` table and their salaries, not courses.
    
- **B. Department names and the total number of students in each department.** Incorrect. The query is working with the `instructor` table, not students.
    
- **C. Department names and the total salary of instructors in each department.** Incorrect. The query counts the number of instructors, not the sum of their salaries.
    
- **D. Department names and the number of instructors earning more than the average salary in each department.** Correct. The query filters for instructors earning more than the overall average salary and then counts how many such instructors are in each department.
    

Therefore, the correct answer is **D. Department names and the number of instructors earning more than the average salary in each department.**

# Q30
![[Pasted image 20250128111740.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
UPDATE instructor
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE dept_name = 'Physics';
```

Let's analyze it:

- **`UPDATE instructor`**: This specifies that we are modifying the `instructor` table.
- **`SET salary = salary * 1.1`**: This is the core of the update. It sets the `salary` column to its current value multiplied by 1.1. This is equivalent to increasing the salary by 10%.
- **`WHERE dept_name = 'Physics'`**: This clause restricts the update to only those instructors who belong to the 'Physics' department.

Therefore, the query updates the salaries of instructors in the Physics department by increasing them by 10%.

Now let's look at the options:

- **A. Deletes the salaries of instructors in the Physics department.** Incorrect. The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing values, it doesn't delete them.
    
- **B. Updates the salaries of instructors in the Physics department by increasing them by 10%.** Correct. This is exactly what the query does.
    
- **C. Inserts new salary records for instructors in the Physics department.** Incorrect. The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing records, it doesn't insert new ones. `INSERT` is used for adding new records.
    
- **D. Selects the salaries of instructors in the Physics department.** Incorrect. The `UPDATE` statement modifies data, it doesn't retrieve it. `SELECT` is used for retrieving data.
    

So, the correct answer is **B. Updates the salaries of instructors in the Physics department by increasing them by 10%.**
# Q31
![[Pasted image 20250128111811.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE dept_name = 'Computer Science' AND salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Computer Science');
```

Let's break it down:

1. **`SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Computer Science'`**: This subquery calculates the average salary of instructors specifically within the 'Computer Science' department.
    
2. **`WHERE dept_name = 'Computer Science' AND salary > (...)`**: This clause filters the instructors. It selects only those instructors who meet _both_ of these conditions:
    
    - They belong to the 'Computer Science' department.
    - Their salary is greater than the average salary of instructors in the 'Computer Science' department (calculated by the subquery).
3. **`SELECT name FROM instructor`**: The query selects the `name` of the instructors who meet the conditions in the `WHERE` clause.
    

Therefore, the query returns the names of instructors in the Computer Science department who earn more than the average salary within their department.

Looking at the options:

- **A. Names of instructors in all departments earning more than the average salary.** Incorrect. The `WHERE` clause specifically filters for the 'Computer Science' department.
    
- **B. Names of all instructors in the Computer Science department.** Incorrect. The query only selects those earning _more than_ the average salary in that department.
    
- **C. Names of instructors in the Computer Science department earning less than the average salary.** Incorrect. The `>` operator in the `WHERE` clause selects those earning _more than_ the average.
    
- **D. Names of instructors in the Computer Science department earning more than the average salary.** Correct. This accurately describes the query's function.
    

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.


# Q32![[Pasted image 20250128111829.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
SELECT name
FROM student
WHERE tot_cred = (SELECT MIN(tot_cred) FROM student WHERE dept_name = 'Engineering');
```

Let's break it down:

1. **`SELECT MIN(tot_cred) FROM student WHERE dept_name = 'Engineering'`**: This subquery finds the minimum `tot_cred` (total credits) among all students in the 'Engineering' department.
    
2. **`WHERE tot_cred = (...)`**: This clause filters the students. It selects only those students whose `tot_cred` is equal to the minimum `tot_cred` found in the subquery.
    
3. **`SELECT name FROM student`**: This selects the `name` of the students who meet the condition.
    

Therefore, the query returns the names of students who have the minimum total credits among students in the Engineering department.

Considering the options:

- **A. Names of students with the minimum total credits in Engineering.** Correct. This is exactly what the query does.
    
- **B. Names of students with the maximum total credits in Engineering.** Incorrect. The query uses `MIN(tot_cred)`, not `MAX(tot_cred)`.
    
- **C. Names of all students.** Incorrect. The `WHERE` clause filters the students based on their department and total credits.
    
- **D. Names of students with the average total credits in Engineering.** Incorrect. The query uses `MIN(tot_cred)`, not `AVG(tot_cred)`.
    

So, the correct answer is **A. Names of students with the minimum total credits in Engineering.**
# Q33
![[Pasted image 20250128111848.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE dept_name = 'Physics' AND salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Physics' AND hire_date > '2020-01-01');
```

Let's analyze it:

1. **`SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Physics' AND hire_date > '2020-01-01'`**: This subquery finds the maximum salary among instructors in the Physics department who were hired _after_ January 1, 2020.
    
2. **`WHERE dept_name = 'Physics' AND salary = (...)`**: This clause in the outer query filters the instructors based on two conditions:
    
    - They must be in the 'Physics' department.
    - Their salary must be equal to the maximum salary found by the subquery (i.e., the highest salary among those hired after January 1, 2020).
3. **`SELECT name FROM instructor`**: This selects the `name` of the instructors who meet both conditions.
    

Therefore, the query returns the names of instructors in the Physics department who earn the highest salary among those hired _after_ January 1, 2020.

Now, let's consider the options:

- **A. Names of instructors in the Physics department earning the lowest salary.** Incorrect. The query uses `MAX(salary)`, not `MIN(salary)`.
    
- **B. None of these.** Incorrect. Option D is the correct answer.
    
- **C. Names of all instructors in the Physics department.** Incorrect. The query filters based on salary and hire date.
    
- **D. Names of instructors in the Physics department earning the highest salary among those hired _after_ January 1, 2020.** Correct. This accurately describes the query's function. The question states "before January 1, 2020", but the query uses greater than `hire_date > '2020-01-01'` which is after.
    

So, the correct answer is **D**.
# Q34
![[Pasted image 20250128111905.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE dept_name = 'Biology' AND salary BETWEEN 60000 AND (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Biology');
```

Let's break it down:

1. **`SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Biology'`**: This subquery finds the maximum salary among instructors in the 'Biology' department.
    
2. **`WHERE dept_name = 'Biology' AND salary BETWEEN 60000 AND (...)`**: This clause filters instructors based on two conditions:
    
    - They must be in the 'Biology' department.
    - Their `salary` must be between 60000 and the maximum salary in the Biology department (inclusive). The `BETWEEN` operator includes both the start and end values.
3. **`SELECT name FROM instructor`**: This selects the `name` of the instructors who meet both conditions.
    

Therefore, the query returns the names of instructors in the Biology department whose salaries are between 60000 and the maximum salary earned by any Biology instructor.

Considering the options:

- **A. Names of instructors in the Biology department earning between 60000 and the maximum salary.** Correct. This accurately describes the query's function.
    
- **B. Names of instructors in the Biology department earning less than 60000.** Incorrect. The `BETWEEN` clause specifies a range _including_ 60000 and the maximum salary.
    
- **C. Names of all instructors in the Biology department.** Incorrect. The query filters based on salary.
    
- **D. Names of instructors in the Biology department earning more than the maximum salary.** Incorrect. The `BETWEEN` clause specifies a range _up to and including_ the maximum salary.
    

So, the correct answer is **A**.
# Q35
![[Pasted image 20250128111920.png]]
The problem with the query is **C. The AND clause is incorrect.**

Here's why:

The `AND` operator in SQL is used to combine two or more conditions in a `WHERE` clause. It requires a complete condition on _both_ sides. In the provided query:

SQL

```
UPDATE instructor
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE dept_name = 'Physics'
AND;
```

The `AND` is followed by nothing. It's expecting another condition to be specified after it, such as `AND some_other_column = some_value`. Because there's no complete condition after `AND`, the SQL statement is syntactically incorrect and will result in an error.

The other options are incorrect:

- **A. The UPDATE clause is incorrect.** The `UPDATE instructor` part is syntactically correct. It correctly identifies the table to be updated.
    
- **B. The WHERE clause is incomplete.** The `WHERE dept_name = 'Physics'` part is a valid condition. The problem is not with the `WHERE` clause itself, but with the incomplete `AND` clause that follows it.
    
- **D. The SET clause is incorrect.** The `SET salary = salary * 1.1` part is syntactically correct. It correctly specifies how the `salary` column should be updated.
- 
# Q36
![[Pasted image 20250128111934.png]]
The SQL query is:

SQL

```
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Biology');
```

Let's break it down:

1. **`SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Biology'`**: This subquery calculates the average salary of instructors _specifically_ in the 'Biology' department.
    
2. **`WHERE salary > (...)`**: The outer query filters the instructors. It selects only those instructors whose `salary` is _greater than_ the average salary calculated by the subquery (the average Biology department salary).
    
3. **`SELECT name FROM instructor`**: This selects the `name` of the instructors who meet the condition.
    

Therefore, the query returns the names of instructors who earn _more than_ the average salary in the Biology department.

Considering the options:

- **A. Names of instructors earning less than the average salary in Biology.** Incorrect. The `>` operator means "greater than," not "less than."
    
- **B. Names of all instructors.** Incorrect. The `WHERE` clause filters the instructors based on their salary relative to the Biology department's average.
    
- **C. Names of instructors earning more than the average salary in Biology.** Correct. This is exactly what the query does.
    
- **D. Names of instructors earning the average salary in Biology.** Incorrect. The `>` operator means "greater than," not "equal to."
    

The correct answer is **C**.
# Q37
A system catalog is a repository of information describing the data in the database.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**A. True**

A system catalog is a specialized type of database that contains metadata about the database itself. This metadata includes information about:

- **Tables:** Names, columns, data types, constraints, indexes, etc.
- **Views:** Definitions of virtual tables.
- **Users:** User accounts, privileges, and permissions.
- **Indexes:** Information about indexes created on tables.
- **Stored procedures:** Definitions of stored procedures.

Essentially, the system catalog acts as a dictionary or a blueprint for the database, providing information about its structure and components.

# Q38
Data storage definition language is used to specify the conceptual schema in the database.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**B. False**

Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to specify the conceptual schema in a database, not Data Storage Definition Language (which is not a standard term).

**Here's why:**

- **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
    - Used to create, modify, and delete database objects like tables, views, indexes, and constraints.
    - Defines the schema of the database, including the structure of tables, data types, and relationships.
    - Examples of DDL statements include:
        - `CREATE TABLE`
        - `ALTER TABLE`
        - `DROP TABLE`
        - `CREATE INDEX`
        - `CREATE VIEW`

**Data Storage Definition Language is not a recognized term in the context of database systems.** If you're encountering this term in a specific context, it might be a custom term or a misnomer.

If you have any more questions about database concepts or SQL, feel free to ask!

# Q39
The external schema defines how and where the data are organized in a physical data storage.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**B. False**

The external schema (also known as a view) describes how users see the data. It provides a customized view of the database, showing only the data relevant to a particular user or application. It _does not_ define how the data is physically stored.

Here's a breakdown of the database schemas:

- **External Schema (View Level):** This is the user's view of the data. It can show a subset of the data, derived data, or data from multiple tables combined in a way that is meaningful to the user. Multiple external schemas can exist for the same database.
    
- **Conceptual Schema (Logical Level):** This describes the overall structure of the database, including the entities, attributes, and relationships between them. It represents the "big picture" of the data.
    
- **Internal Schema (Physical Level):** This describes how the data is physically stored on the storage devices. It includes details like file organization, data structures, and storage locations.
    

Therefore, the internal schema defines how and where the data are organized in physical storage, not the external schema.
# Q40
In DBMS, data files are the files that store the database information.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**A. True**

Data files are indeed the files that store the actual database information. They contain the data that users interact with, organized according to the database's schema. These files are distinct from other files related to the database, such as:

- **Log files:** Used for transaction logging and recovery.
- **Index files:** Used to speed up data retrieval.
- **Configuration files:** Used to store database settings.

So, the statement "In DBMS, data files are the files that store the database information" is **true**.

# Q41
Metadata is also known as data about data.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**A. True**

Metadata is indeed "data about data." It provides information about various aspects of the data, such as:

- **Structure:** How the data is organized (e.g., table names, column names, data types).
- **Meaning:** The definition and context of the data.
- **Origin:** Where the data came from.
- **Usage:** How the data is used.

For example, in a database:

- The data itself might be customer names, addresses, and order information.
- The metadata would be things like the table names (e.g., "Customers," "Orders"), the column names (e.g., "customer_id," "order_date"), the data types of those columns (e.g., INTEGER, DATE, VARCHAR), and any constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
# Q42
In a database, data integrity can be maintained.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**A. True**

Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database. Database Management Systems (DBMS) provide several mechanisms to maintain data integrity:

- **Constraints:** Rules enforced on data to prevent invalid entries. Examples include:
    
    - **Primary Key constraints:** Ensure unique identification of records.
    - **Foreign Key constraints:** Maintain referential integrity between related tables.
    - **NOT NULL constraints:** Prevent null values in required columns.
    - **UNIQUE constraints:** Ensure uniqueness of values in specified columns.
    - **CHECK constraints:** Define custom rules for data values.
- **Transactions:** Ensure that database operations are performed as atomic units of work. Either all changes within a transaction are committed (saved), or none are (rolled back), preventing partial updates and inconsistencies.
    
- **Triggers:** Stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain database events (e.g., insertion, update, or deletion of data). They can be used to enforce complex business rules and maintain data consistency.
    
- **Data Validation:** Input validation checks at the application level can also contribute to data integrity by preventing incorrect or malicious data from ever reaching the database.
    

Therefore, DBMS provide various tools and techniques to ensure that data integrity is maintained.

# Q43
Structured query language (SQL) and query by example (QBE) are examples of fourth-generation languages.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**A. True**

Structured Query Language (SQL) and Query By Example (QBE) are both considered fourth-generation languages (4GLs).

Here's why:

- **Generations of Programming Languages:** Programming languages have evolved through several generations, each characterized by increasing levels of abstraction and ease of use:
    
    - **1GL (First Generation):** Machine code (binary).
    - **2GL (Second Generation):** Assembly language.
    - **3GL (Third Generation):** High-level procedural languages (e.g., C, Java, Pascal).
    - **4GL (Fourth Generation):** Languages designed for specific purposes, often involving database access and reporting. They are more declarative than procedural, meaning you specify _what_ you want, not _how_ to get it. SQL and QBE fall into this category.
    - **5GL (Fifth Generation):** Languages based on artificial intelligence and constraint programming.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Allows users to define what data they want to retrieve from a database without specifying the exact steps to retrieve it.
    
- **QBE (Query By Example):** A visual query language where users specify the desired data by filling in tables with example values. The system then translates this visual representation into a query that can be executed against the database.
    

Therefore, since both SQL and QBE provide a higher level of abstraction and are designed for database interaction, they are classified as 4GLs.

# Q44
Data is a piece of fact.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**A. True**

Data is indeed a piece of fact. It represents raw, unorganized information that can be recorded and stored. It can take many forms, such as numbers, text, images, audio, or video.

Here's a distinction between data and information:

- **Data:** Raw, unprocessed facts and figures.
- **Information:** Processed, organized, and structured data that provides context and meaning.

For example:

- **Data:** The number "75".
- **Information:** "The student scored 75% on the exam."

So, the statement "Data is a piece of fact" is accurate.
# Q45

A database schema is a blueprint that defines the structure of a database.A. TrueB. False

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

**A. True**

A database schema is indeed a blueprint that defines the structure of a database. It describes:

- **Tables:** The names of tables and their columns.
- **Data types:** The types of data that can be stored in each column (e.g., integer, text, date).
- **Constraints:** Rules that the data must follow (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints).
- **Relationships:** How the tables are related to each other.

Think of it like an architectural blueprint for a building. The schema specifies how the data is organized and how different parts of the data relate to one another.
