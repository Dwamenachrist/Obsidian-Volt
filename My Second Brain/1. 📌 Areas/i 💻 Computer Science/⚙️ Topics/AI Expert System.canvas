      "text": "You're right—since this is a **rule-based expert system** and not a machine learning model, we don't need Kaggle datasets in the way ML models do. Instead, let's focus on a more **realistic, structured, and approved approach** for building the expert system.\n\n---\n\n### **Revised Approach for Rule-Based Expert System**\n\nInstead of using Kaggle datasets directly, we will extract **domain knowledge** from trusted sources and manually define **rules** that the system will use.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Confirming the Target Audience**\n\n- **Suggestion 1:** The system is for **undergraduate university students** to help them choose careers based on skills, personality, and academic performance.\n- **Suggestion 2:** The system is for **high school graduates and undergraduates** who need career guidance based on structured rule-based decision-making.\n\n✔ **Preferred:** Suggestion 1 (since the system is primarily focused on students already in university, but can be expanded later).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Where Do the Rules Come From?**\n\nSince this is a **rule-based** system, we need to define rules based on **approved career frameworks**. Here’s how:\n\n- **Suggestion 1:** Use data from career frameworks such as **O*NET, My Next Move, and university career counseling guides** to extract logical rules (e.g., \"A student with strong analytical skills and a math background is suitable for Data Science\").\n- **Suggestion 2:** Develop rules based on **industry-standard job descriptions** from platforms like LinkedIn, government labor statistics, and university career handbooks.\n\n✔ **Preferred:** Suggestion 1 (O*NET and My Next Move are research-backed and align well with rule-based logic).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Expert Involvement or Rule Justification**\n\nSince we don’t have time to consult an expert, how do we **validate** the career rules?\n\n- **Suggestion 1:** Use **pre-existing structured knowledge sources (like university career counseling materials)** to verify rule accuracy.\n- **Suggestion 2:** Use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT trained on career-related data) to cross-check the logic but still manually review the final rules.\n\n✔ **Preferred:** Suggestion 1 (since AI tools can assist, but manual verification from structured resources is more reliable for submission).\n\n---\n\n### **4. How Will the System Work?**\n\nNow that we have **approved rule sources**, how do we implement the system?\n\n- **Suggestion 1:** **Manually translate** these structured career mappings into **IF-THEN** rules in Python or a rule-based engine like **Drools**.\n- **Suggestion 2:** Use a **decision tree** (hardcoded logic in Python) that follows a structured career-matching process.\n\n✔ **Preferred:** Suggestion 1 (Explicit IF-THEN rules are better for a rule-based expert system).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Time and Implementation Feasibility**\n\nTo ensure we complete the project **today**, how do we keep the implementation simple?\n\n- **Suggestion 1:** Define **core rules** first (major career paths), test them, and refine later.\n- **Suggestion 2:** Skip ML or complex NLP and strictly focus on **structured rule-based decision-making**.\n\n✔ **Preferred:** Suggestion 2 (Keeps implementation within the deadline).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Approved Approach**\n\n✅ Target Audience: **University students needing career guidance**  \n✅ Rules Source: **O*NET, My Next Move, and university career counseling materials**  \n✅ Validation: **Manual review based on structured sources**  \n✅ Implementation: **Explicit IF-THEN rules in Python or Drools**  \n✅ Feasibility: **Strictly rule-based (no ML, no NLP, no complex processing)**\n\n---\n\nThis ensures the expert system is **realistic, approved, and can be completed today**.  \nDo you agree with this approach, or do you need any further adjustments?",
