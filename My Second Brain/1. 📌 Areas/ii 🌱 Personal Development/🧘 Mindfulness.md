Let’s design a test to evaluate your learning with AI and critical thinking skills as a developer. This will focus on your ability to use AI effectively while still deeply understanding the code, preparing for technical interviews, and confidently explaining concepts.

### **Part 1: Code Understanding and Explanation**

1. **Task**: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. Use AI to assist, if necessary.
2. **Check**:
    - Can you explain how recursion works in your code? For example, how does the function call itself, and what are the base and recursive cases?
    - Why did you implement it this way, and what alternatives could you use (e.g., iteration)?
    - If you had to modify the function to handle large inputs efficiently, what would you do?

### **Part 2: Debugging Challenge**

1. **Task**: Debug the following faulty function (I’ll describe it instead of providing AI-generated code to ensure you analyze it yourself):
    - The function aims to reverse a string, but instead, it throws an error when called with an empty string. Identify the issue and fix it.
2. **Check**:
    - Can you describe the process you used to debug without relying solely on AI?
    - What changes did you make, and why?
    - Did you test edge cases, such as single-character strings or strings with spaces?

### **Part 3: Simulated Technical Interview**

1. **Task**: Imagine you're in a technical interview. Explain the following:
    - The purpose of binary search and its time complexity.
    - How you'd design a URL shortening service, including handling scalability and edge cases.
2. **Check**:
    - Can you explain concepts clearly, without technical jargon, to a less experienced audience?
    - Do your answers include a strong understanding of the logic and constraints behind the solutions?

### **Part 4: Self-Reflection**

1. **Task**: After completing the tasks above, answer these questions:
    - Did you rely heavily on AI? If so, do you feel you truly understand the code it generated?
    - Could you replicate the solutions without AI, or are there gaps in your understanding?
    - How would you approach improving your skills in areas where you feel less confident?

By working through this test, you’ll get a better sense of how well you're using AI to enhance learning, whether you're developing foundational skills, and if you're ready for technical interviews. Feel free to tackle these tasks one by one—I can support you along the way! Which part do you want to dive into first?
