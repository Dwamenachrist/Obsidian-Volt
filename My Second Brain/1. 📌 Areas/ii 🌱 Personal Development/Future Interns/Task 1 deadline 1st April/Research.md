### <u>Time series forecasting</u>
**Trend Analysis** is one of the key parts of this project. But time series analysis has different components, and we’ll explore them all:

1. **Trend Analysis** – Finding the long-term direction of sales (upward, downward, or stable).
2. **Seasonality Analysis** – Checking if sales follow a repeated pattern (e.g., sales increase every December).
3. **Moving Averages & Lag Features** – Smoothing data and using past sales to predict future sales.
4. **Forecasting** – Using models like Prophet or Regression to predict future sales.

**What is Moving Average?**  
A **moving average** helps **smooth out short-term fluctuations** to reveal the underlying trend in the data.
