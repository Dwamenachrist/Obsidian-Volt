Okay, let's refine the structure with icons and clarify the levels after "Computer Science."  Think of it like a file system hierarchy.

**Here's the structure with icons and details, envisioning it as a tree diagram:**

**Explanation of Levels After "Computer Science":**

* **`📁 Computer Science` is a folder within the `📌 Areas` folder.**
* **Inside `📁 Computer Science`, you have subfolders:**
    * **`📚 Courses`:**  This holds notes specifically related to your academic courses. You can further organize this by individual course names.
    * **`⚙️ Topics`:** This is for broader fields and fundamental concepts within computer science.
    * **`🐍 Programming Languages`:**  Notes about specific programming languages you are learning or using.

>**Yes**, with the **`Code Runner`**  plugin, you can execute code snippets directly within Obsidian notes.
> 
> **Steps to run code in Obsidian with `Code Runner`:**
> 
> 1. **Install the Plugin**:
>    - Open Obsidian.
>    - Go to "Settings" > "Community Plugins".
>    - Search for and install the "Code Runner" plugin.
> 
> 2. **Setup Code Block**:
>    - Create a new note or open an existing one.
>    - Insert a code block by surrounding code with three backticks:
>      ```
>      ```<language name>
>      // Your code here
>      ```
>    ```
>    - Replace `<language name>` with the language you want to run, such as [[[[[[Python]]]]]], [[[[[[JavaScript]]]]]], or bash.
> 
> 3. **Execute Code**:
>    - Click the "Run" button that appears at the bottom of the code block.
>    - The result of the code execution will be displayed below the code block.
> 
> **Limitations**:
> 
> * The plugin only supports certain languages, including [[Python]], [[JavaScript]], Bash, and a few others.
> * Code that requires external libraries or dependencies may not run.
> * Long or complex code may take time to execute.
> 
> **Tips**:
> 
> * Use the `output` function to display results within the code.
> * Debug code by adding `debugger` statements and using the built-in debugger.
> * Customize plugin settings to control output handling and other options.


**Key Points about the Structure:**

* **Top-Level Folders:** These are the broadest categories.
* **Subfolders:**  Organize the content within the top-level folders. Think of logical groupings.
* **Even Deeper Subfolders:**  You can have subfolders within subfolders (e.g., specific course folders within `📚 Courses`).
* **Individual Notes ("Pages"):** Inside these folders and subfolders, you will create your individual notes (Markdown files). These are the "pages" of your second brain. For example, within `📚 Courses/[[[[CS 201 - Data Structures & Algorithms]]]]`, you might have notes like "Linked Lists.md", "Binary Trees.md", etc.

**How to Interpret the Diagram:**

* **`📁`:** Represents a folder.
* **`├──`:**  Indicates that the following item is inside the folder above it.
* **`│   ├──`:** Indicates a sub-item within a subfolder.
* **Icons:**  Provide a visual cue for the folder's purpose. You can choose your own icons!

**Beyond Computer Science - Examples of Subfolders:**

* **`🌱 Personal Development`:**  Could have subfolders for `Goals`, `[[[[[[Habit Tracking]]]]]]`, `Mindfulness`, `Book Summaries` (related to personal growth).
* **`🙏 Bible Study`:** Could have subfolders for `Sermon Notes`, `Passage Analysis`, `Personal Reflections`, `Topical Studies`.
* **`✨ Creative Projects`:** Could have subfolders for specific types of creative work like `Writing Projects`, `Art Ideas`, `Music Compositions`.[[Templates]]
* **`✅ Projects`:** Each specific project gets its own subfolder to keep related notes together.
* **`🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People`:** You might organize by relationship type (Family, Colleagues, Friends) or by groups (Project Teams, Club Members).

**Remember:** This is a starting point. You can customize it to fit your specific needs and preferences. Don't be afraid to adjust the structure as you go! The key is to have a system that makes sense to *you* and helps you find information easily.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Create the main folders in your Obsidian vault.**
2. **Start adding the subfolders within each main folder.**
3. **Begin creating notes within those folders.**  Focus on one area to start, like your current Computer Science course.
4. **Practice linking your notes together!** This is where the real power of Obsidian comes in.
