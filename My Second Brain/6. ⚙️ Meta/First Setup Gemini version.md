Yes, absolutely! We can make this amazing. Consider me your Obsidian Sherpa. Let's get this second brain of yours built.

**Here's the straightforward, step-by-step guide to structuring your Obsidian vault for a computer science student taking notes on everything:**

**Step 1: Initial Setup & Core Principles**

- **Download and Install Obsidian:** Go to [https://obsidian.md/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fobsidian.md%2F) and download the version for your operating system. Install it.
    
- **Create Your Vault:**
    
    - Open Obsidian.
        
    - Click "Create new vault".
        
    - Choose a location on your computer where you want to store your notes. A folder named "Obsidian Vault" or something similar is a good start.
        
    - Give your vault a name (e.g., "My Second Brain").
        
    - Click "Create".
        
- **Understand the Core Concepts:**
    
    - **Notes:** These are your individual files where you write your information. They are plain text files with Markdown formatting.
        
    - **Links:** This is the magic of Obsidian! You connect your notes together using [[My Note Layout]]. This creates a bi-directional link â€“ if you link from Note A to Note B, Note B also knows it's linked from Note A. 
        
    - **Folders:** Use folders for broad organization. Think of them as high-level categories.
        
    - **Tags:** Use tags (#yourtag) for more granular categorization and quick filtering across your entire vault.
        

**Step 2: Basic Folder Structure**

This is a good starting point, and you can adapt it as you go. Don't overthink it initially.

- **Main Folders (at the top level of your vault):**
    
    - **Areas:** This folder is for the major areas of your life. Think big, ongoing responsibilities or interests. Examples:
        
        - Areas/Computer Science
            
        - Areas/Personal Development
            
        - Areas/Bible Study
            
        - Areas/Creative Projects
            
    - **Projects:** This folder is for specific, time-bound endeavors with a clear goal. Examples:
        
        - Projects/Final Year Project
            
        - Projects/Learn [Specific Technology]
            
        - Projects/Plan Vacation
            
    - **Resources:** This folder is for storing information you gather from external sources.
        
        - Resources/Documents
            
        - Resources/Images
            
        - Resources/Social Media Content
            
        - Resources/ChatGPT AI Content
            
        - Resources/YouTube
            
        - Resources/LinkedIn
            
        - Resources/NotebookLM Pods
            
        - Resources/Movies
            
        - Resources/Songs
            
        - Resources/Videos
            
        - Resources/Books
            
    - **People:** Information about individuals.
        
    - **Daily Notes:** For journaling, daily reflections, and quick capture.
        
    - **Meta:** For notes about your note-taking system itself, [[Templates]], and other organizational tools.
        
- **Subfolders (within the main folders):** Start simple. You can add more as needed.
    
    - **Inside Areas/Computer Science:** Courses, Topics, Programming Languages, Concepts, Projects
        
    - **Inside Areas/Bible Study:** Sermons, Passages, Reflections
        
    - **Inside Resources/Social Media Content:** You might have subfolders for specific platforms (YouTube, LinkedIn).
        

**Step 3: Essential Plugins and How to Use Them**

These are plugins that will significantly enhance your Obsidian experience for your specific needs.

1. **Core Plugins (Built-in, Enable them):**
    
    - **Backlinks:** Shows you which notes link to the current note. Enable this. It's crucial for seeing connections.
        
    - **Outgoing Links:** Shows you which notes the current note links to. Enable this. Also crucial for seeing connections.
        
    - **Graph View:** Visually represents your notes and their connections. Enable this. This is like looking at your brain's connections. You can access it by opening a note and clicking the three dots in the top right, then "Open in new pane" and choosing "Graph view". Experiment with the filters and settings on the left to customize the view.
        
    - **Tags:** Allows you to add and manage tags. Enable this.
        
    - **[[Templates]]:** Lets you create reusable note structures. Enable this. We'll use this later.
        
2. **Community Plugins (Install these):**
    
    - **Install Community Plugins:**
        
        - Click the "Settings" icon (gear) in the bottom left.
            
        - Go to "Community plugins".
            
        - Click "Turn on community plugins".
            
        - Click "Browse".
            
    - **"QuickAdd":** This is your Swiss Army knife for quickly capturing information from anywhere.
        
        - **Install and Enable:** Search for "QuickAdd" and click "Install," then "Enable."
            
        - **Basic Usage:**
            
            - **Capture from Clipboard:** Configure a "Capture" choice in QuickAdd that grabs the text from your clipboard and creates a new note (or appends to an existing one). This is fantastic for copying snippets from websites, chats, etc.
                
            - **Create New Notes from [[Templates]]:** You can set up QuickAdd to create notes based on [[Templates]] in specific folders.
                
            - **More Advanced:** It can do much more, like creating multiple notes at once, but start with simple capture.
                
    - **"Readwise Official":** If you use Readwise to collect highlights from books, articles, and podcasts, this plugin seamlessly syncs those highlights into your Obsidian vault as Markdown notes.
        
        - **Install and Enable:** Search for "Readwise Official," install, and enable.
            
        - **Configuration:** You'll need to connect your Readwise account. Follow the plugin's instructions.
            
    - **"Web Clipper":** Allows you to clip content from web pages directly into your Obsidian vault.
        
        - **Install and Enable:** Search for "Web Clipper," install, and enable.
            
        - **Usage:** You'll likely need to install a browser extension (the plugin will guide you). Once installed, you can clip articles, parts of web pages, etc., and save them as notes in Obsidian.
            
    - **"Obsidian [[Git]]":** This plugin allows you to back up your Obsidian vault using [[Git]] (like GitHub). Crucial for protecting your valuable notes.
        
        - **Install and Enable:** Search for "Obsidian [[Git]]," install, and enable.
            
        - **Basic Usage:** You'll need a [[Git]] repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab). Configure the plugin to point to your repository and set up automatic backups. There are many tutorials online for using [[Git]].
            
    - **"Dataview":** This is a powerful plugin for querying and displaying information from your notes based on their metadata (tags, frontmatter). It might be a little more advanced, but it's incredibly useful for creating dynamic indexes and overviews.
        
        - **Install and Enable:** Search for "Dataview," install, and enable.
            
        - **Basic Usage:** You can use it to create lists of notes with specific tags, or notes within a certain folder, and display their properties. We'll see an example later.
            

**Step 4: Taking Notes and Connecting Them**

- **Creating Notes:**
    
    - Click the "New note" icon (top left).
        
    - Give your note a descriptive title. Think about what you'll be searching for later.
        
- **Linking Notes:**
    
    - To link to another note, type [[ and start typing the title of the note you want to link to. Obsidian will suggest matching notes. Select the correct one.
        
- **Using Tags:**
    
    - Add tags directly in your notes using the # symbol (e.g., #programming, #[[Python]], #book/atomic-habits). Be consistent with your tagging.
        
- **Frontmatter (Optional but Useful):**
    
    - At the very top of your note (within the first three dashes ---), you can add structured data called "frontmatter". This is useful for adding specific properties to your notes.
        
    - Example:
        
              `--- type: book author: James Clear rating: 5/5 tags: [personal-development, habits] ---`

        Use code [with caution](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/13505487).Yaml
        
- **Capturing Information from Different Sources:**
    
    - **Docs/Text:** Copy and paste directly into a new note, use QuickAdd to capture from the clipboard.
        
    - **Images:** Drag and drop images into your notes. Obsidian will store them in an "Attachments" folder within your vault.
        
    - **Social Media Content (YouTube, LinkedIn):**
        
        - **YouTube:** Use the Web Clipper to save video descriptions or transcripts. You can also link directly to the YouTube video URL.
            
        - **LinkedIn:** Use the Web Clipper to save articles or posts.
            
    - **ChatGPT AI Content:** Copy and paste the relevant sections into your notes. Consider tagging them with #ai-generated.
        
    - **NotebookLM Pods:** If NotebookLM allows exporting, save the export and link to it. Otherwise, summarize key points in a note.
        
    - **Movies/Songs/Videos/Books:** Create notes for each with relevant information (title, author/artist, genre, your thoughts, key takeaways). Link to other relevant notes.
        
    - **People:** Create notes for individuals with details like their name, relationship to you, key interactions, and things you want to remember about them.
        

**Step 5: Example Workflow - Learning a New Programming Concept**

1. **Create a Note:** In your Areas/Computer Science/Topics folder, create a note titled "Object-Oriented Programming".
    
2. **Take Notes:** As you learn about OOP from various sources, add information to this note.
    
3. **Link to Related Concepts:** If you mention "inheritance," link to a note on "Inheritance in OOP" using [[Inheritance in OOP]]. If the note doesn't exist yet, Obsidian will create a placeholder for you.
    
4. **Tag Relevant Information:** Use tags like #programming, #oop, #[[Python]] (if the examples are in [[Python]]).
    
5. **Capture from Resources:** If you find a helpful explanation on a website, use the Web Clipper to save it to your Resources/Web Clips folder and link to that note from your "Object-Oriented Programming" note.
    
6. **Connect to Projects:** If you're using OOP in a specific project, link from the "Object-Oriented Programming" note to the relevant project note in your Projects folder.
    

**Step 6: Leveraging Plugins for Deeper Organization**

- **QuickAdd for Fast Capture:** Set up QuickAdd to create new notes from [[Templates]]. For example, you could have a "Book Note" template with predefined fields like "Title," "Author," "Key Takeaways," and "Rating."
    
- **Readwise for Automated Import:** Let Readwise automatically import your highlights from books and articles, saving you manual work.
    
- **Dataview for Overviews:**
    
    - Create a note titled "Computer Science Concepts Overview" in your Areas/Computer Science folder.
        
    - Use Dataview to create a table of all your notes tagged with #concept:
        
              `TABLE file.mtime AS "Last Modified" FROM #concept SORT file.mtime DESC`
            
        
        content_copy download
        
        Use code [with caution](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/13505487).Dataview
        
    - This will show you a dynamically updating list of your concept notes, ordered by when they were last modified. You can do similar queries for books, people, etc.
        

**Step 7: Iterate and Refine**

- **Don't aim for perfection immediately.** Your system will evolve as you use it.
    
- **Review your notes regularly.** This helps solidify the information and identify new connections.
    
- **Experiment with different organizational structures and plugin configurations.** Find what works best for you.
    
- **Use the Graph View frequently.** It helps you visualize the connections and identify gaps in your knowledge.
    

**Key Takeaways for You:**

- **Start simple with folders and notes.** Don't overcomplicate it initially.
